# Self Critique

This project was a lot of work. For me, the most important part was making the website, as minimalistic as possible. 
I didn't really care about adding anything that wasn't absolutely essential. One of my main challenges was adding the slide-out nav-bar.
That took some doing, but it taught me a lot about how to correctly implement CSS into a webpage. The class so far has taught me a
great deal about how important it is to make a webpage in such a way that it engages human emotions. Human-computer interaction
is just about one of the most important things you can study when you are in the service industry and want to make money for your company!

# Shan Shazad critique

Shan worked mostly on the logo on our web page and the classes display page. He also worked on the h1 tag in the CSS file to make it
stand out more. He was useful in testing the site on safari and Mac products.

# Marco Hernandez critique

Marco worked on the Add/drop page. I love how it was handled and how it turned out. The js allows you to delete a field and remove 
a field. This is impressive since Github pages serves only static content and the js makes it look as if it is dynamic!

# Denis Komarov critique

queries still elude me, but I get how they work. Denis was able to implement two queries for small and larger screens. He also added the
normalization CS
